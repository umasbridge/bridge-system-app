## Conventions Unique to Each System

### SAYC has but GIB doesn't show:
- XYZ convention (instead of NMF)
- Drury (1M-2C as limit raise)
- Specific super-accept structures

### GIB has but SAYC doesn't explicitly document:
- Detailed competitive sequences
- Full Cappelletti defense
- Full Lebensohl responses
- Extensive cue-bid sequences

---

## Recommendation

GIB and SAYC are both "Standard American" derivatives but have key differences:

1. **2/1 Structure**: GIB is pure 2/1 GF; SAYC uses Drury hybrid
2. **Checkback**: GIB uses NMF; SAYC uses XYZ
3. **Ranges**: GIB is more explicit about point ranges and shapes
4. **Competitive**: GIB has far more competitive sequences documented

For rule database purposes, keep GIB alerts as primary source since they reflect actual robot behavior on BBO.
